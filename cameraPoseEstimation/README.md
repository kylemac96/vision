# Camera pose estimation

This package is an interface for the nvidia JETSON TX2 with a IMX385 ip camera 
to achieve camera pose estimation. The system impliments the following features:

 - Camera connection
 - Camera calibration
 - Pose estimation using the perspective-n-points method

# TODO:

Some things that still need to be done:

 - Turn the 3d plot into a function that is a part of .self
 - *** Visual odometry **** in test 
 - Apply the funtion for 3d plots and compare with bench marks
 - Add test into the main script as a file
 - Add explination about the visual odometry and why only a bench mark file can be used
